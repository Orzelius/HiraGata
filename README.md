## Stuff I used
I built it on my [React-Typescript-with-other-nice-things-boilerplate](https://github.com/Orzelius/React-Typescript-with-other-nice-things-boilerplate). It mostly has the same stuff.  Also big thanks to [WanaKana](https://github.com/WaniKani/WanaKana) as I used a ton of it for simple conversions.

## Japanese vocab
If you need the Japanese vocabulary, you could copy it from [./japanese_word_source_files](https://github.com/Orzelius/HiraKata/tree/master/japanese_word_source_files) or straight from [all_jap.json](https://github.com/Orzelius/HiraKata/blob/master/src/app/all_jap.json). I originallt got the words from [Wikipedia](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:JLPT) and some other sources.
